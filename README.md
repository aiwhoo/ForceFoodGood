# ForceFoodGood – GrubHub Clone

ForceFoodGood is a simple GrubHub-style food ordering app we made to practice backend coding and object-oriented programming. It shows how a basic food delivery system works. Users can browse restaurants, add menu items to their order, and see the total price.

### What the project includes:

* User class – stores user information and order history
* Restaurant class – manages restaurant details and menus
* MenuItem class – represents individual food items
* Order class – keeps track of items ordered and calculates total cost

### What we are learning:

* How to use object-oriented programming (OOP)
* How to organize backend logic
* How food ordering systems work
* How to use GitHub professionally (issues, branches, pull requests, code reviews)

This project helps us practice writing cleaner code and working in a team environment.
