# ForceFoodGood

## Project Overview

ForceFoodGood is a simplified food ordering web application inspired by platforms like GrubHub. The project is built using HTML and JavaScript and is designed to simulate the core functionality of an online restaurant ordering system.

Users can browse restaurants, view menu items, add items to a cart, and place orders. The system is structured using Object-Oriented Programming principles to model real-world entities such as restaurants, menu items, carts, users, and orders.

This project is part of a collaborative software development assignment focused on version control, clean architecture, and professional Git workflows.

## Project Goals

The main goals of ForceFoodGood are:

- Implement core food ordering features in a structured web application
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in JavaScript
- Practice data validation and error handling to maintain system integrity
- Use Git and GitHub for collaboration, branching, and pull requests
- Develop skills in resolving merge conflicts and participating in code reviews

This project emphasizes both technical implementation and professional software development practices.

## Core Features

- Create and manage restaurants
- Add and view menu items
- Prevent duplicate menu entries
- Add items to a shopping cart
- Remove items from a cart
- Calculate total order price
- Place orders and track order information

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Git
- GitHub

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure where each class represents a specific responsibility:

- `Restaurant` - Manages restaurant details and menu items
- `MenuItem` - Represents individual food items
- `Cart` - Manages items selected by the user
- `Order` - Represents completed transactions
- `User` - Stores user-related data

This separation of responsibilities improves maintainability and scalability.
